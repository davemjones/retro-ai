I'm continuing work on a retrospective web app for agile teams. The project uses Next.js, TypeScript, Shadcn UI, and PostgreSQL. The dev container is set up with the database running. 

Please read CLAUDE-MEMORY.md and PLAN.md to understand the project context. The next task is to initialize the Next.js project inside this dev container and set up the basic project structure.

The database connection string is: postgresql://retroai:password@db:5432/retroai

Let's continue from where we left off by:
1. Initializing the Next.js project
2. Setting up Prisma with the database schema
3. Configuring authentication
